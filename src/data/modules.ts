        content: `Carbon emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes.

Key Sources of Carbon Emissions:
‚Ä¢ Energy Production (25%): Power plants burning fossil fuels
‚Ä¢ Agriculture & Land Use (24%): Deforestation, livestock, farming
‚Ä¢ Industry (21%): Manufacturing, cement production, chemicals
‚Ä¢ Transportation (14%): Cars, trucks, ships, airplanes
‚Ä¢ Buildings (6%): Heating, cooling, lighting
‚Ä¢ Other Energy Uses (10%): Various industrial processes

The greenhouse effect occurs when these gases trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change.`,
